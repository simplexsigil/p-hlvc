# Pose-based Contrastive Learning for Domain Agnostic Activity Representations

This repository will contain the original implementation of Pose-based High Level View Contrasting (P-HLVC).
This technique applies contrastive clustering on latent space representations generated by a two stream network
applied to augmented video views and body pose motion.

## Research Focus
HLVC aims at improving the action recognition performance on small cross-domain datasets by learning semantic video representations
based on body movements on very large pretraining datasets. Learning these pose-motion based semantic representations
facilitates the learning process of human actions in a domain generalizable manner (e.g. from synthetic to real data). Labelling large amounts of data
proves to be increasingly difficult with the ever-growing size of pre-training datasets and P-HLVC does not require any human
annotated labels on the pre-training dataset.

P-HLVC is closely related to the topics of unsupervised and self-supervised learning as well as Domain Generalization.
